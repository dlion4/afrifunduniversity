          </ul>
          <p>We collect personally-identifiable, sensitive personally-identifiable information, and non-personally-identifiable information when you provide it to us. For example, if you request to receive offers and alerts or when you complete an online survey. In addition, our business partners and service providers may give us information about you. Please note that, except for limited instances where you choose to interact with us and provide us with your personally-identifiable or sensitive personally-identifiable information directly, you are not required to submit personally-identifiable or sensitive personally-identifiable information.</p>

          <h4 class="h4">Tracking Technologies</h4>

          </ul>

            <li>Your mobile device manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Your mobile service provider.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites, apps, and other online services websites. We may receive reports on this activity on an individual and aggregated basis.</p>
          <p>We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.</p>
          <p>If you do not want us or third parties to collect this information, do not download the App or delete it from your device.</p>
          <p>We or our service providers may also automatically collect non personally-identifiable information about you when you access the Site. The Site and some emails that we may send to you may also use common tracking technologies like:</p>
          <ul>

            <li>Google Analytics for Firebase and Google AMP Client ID API: A service which generates statistical and other information about the use of the Site by means of cookies and tracks a user’s journey across website pages.

          <p>We or our service providers may use your Internet or other electronic network activity information about your activities on the Site (such as the pages that you visit and the key words that you use to search for content), commercial information, and geolocation to help determine what advertisements or offers might be of interest to you. These advertisements may be on the Site or on Third Party Sites. The use of information in this manner is referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” We believe that online behavioral advertising helps to provide you with more relevant advertising based on the websites that you visit.</p>
          <p>You may opt-out of online behavioral advertising by following the instructions in the “Your Opt Out Options” section of this Privacy Policy. Please note that opting out of online behavioral advertising will not stop you from receiving advertisements. However, the advertisements that you see may not be as relevant to you.</p>

          <h4 class="h4">How We Disclose the Information We Collect</h4>
          <p>We may disclose your personally-identifiable or sensitive personally-identifiable information that you provide to us or that we receive from our business partners and/or service providers with our service providers. The services performed by our service providers are done pursuant to a written contract and they process information on behalf of us. For example, we disclose your email address with service providers who send emails on our behalf.</p>
          <p>We may also disclose non-personally-identifiable information with third parties who perform advertising services on our behalf and with companies that operate or analyze the Site. We do not authorize these third parties to collect, use, or disclose this information except as necessary to perform services for us or to comply with law. These third parties may not use the information that we provide to them to independently market to you unless you consent. To the best of our actual knowledge, we do not disclose the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.</p>
          <p>If you are also a customer of Afri Fund University, the disclosure of your personally-identifiable and sensitive personally-identifiable information will be governed by our customer privacy notice that may be accessed by clicking here. For example, we may disclose your personally-identifiable information with third parties as necessary to process a transaction at your request or with our business partners, such as your financial advisors.</p>
          <p>There may be other instances in which we may disclose either your personally-identifiable, sensitive personally-identifiable, or non-personally-identifiable information with a third party. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To respond to a subpoena, warrant, court order or other official governmental actions that are served upon us, and then in conformity with their terms or as we are otherwise permitted or required by law;</li>
            <li>To respond to our regulators or other governmental authorities;</li>
            <li>To protect or defend Afri Fund University or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or their directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, or independent contractors in any legal proceeding;</li>
            <li>Where we suspect fraud or for other risk management purposes;</li>
            <li>As required or permitted by law;</li>
            <li>For any of the uses described in this Privacy Policy;</li>
            <li>To conduct any other legitimate business activities not otherwise prohibited by law; or</li>
            <li>As otherwise instructed or authorized by you.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="h4">Online Security</h4>
          <p>Afri Fund University has developed and maintains security standards that are designed to protect information as it is transmitted from your computer to the network that hosts the Site. This technology is referred to as Secure Socket Layer (SSL), and it is the leading security protocol of data transfer on the Internet.</p>
          <p>However, you also have a significant role in maintaining the security of your information. For example, you should ensure that you have up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware software installed on your device. You should also understand that Afri Fund University will never send you electronic communications (whether they be email or requests made over the Internet) to request sensitive personal information. Similarly, you should never send us your sensitive personal information through a non-secure email channel. If you do communicate with us electronically you consent for us (or our service providers) to reply to you in that medium.</p>
          <p>You are also in control of the information that you share with Afri Fund University, either directly or indirectly. If you are uncomfortable with disclosing your personally-identifiable or sensitive personally-identifiable information with us, the easiest option is not to do so. However, you understand that if you do not disclose such information with us we may be unable to assist you with certain transactions.</p>
          <p>Additionally, if you found information about Afri Fund University on a Third-Party Site – such as a social media site like Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter – you understand that if you share information about yourself on such a Third-Party Site that it will not be governed by this Privacy Policy and, depending on the Third-Party Site, may be visible to all users of that Third-Party Site. You should review the privacy policies and practices of Third-Party Sites before providing information to them.</p>
          <h4 class="h4">How Long Your Personal Information Is Retained</h4>
          <p>We will retain your personal information, including your personally-identifiable or sensitive personally-identifiable information until it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected (for example, to service your loan). We may retain your personal information for longer periods to the extent that we are required by law or regulation, to protect you or others from fraud, as necessary to protect our legal rights, or for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h4 class="h4">Personal Information of Children</h4>
          <p>The Site, and the products and services described on the Site, are intended for use by individuals who are at least 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13 you should not be visiting the Site. We do not knowingly collect or retain personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13 and are visiting or otherwise using the Site you are advised not to disclose or provide any personally-identifiable information on the Site.</p>
          <h4 class="h4">If You Access the Site from Outside the United States</h4>
          <p>If you reside outside of the United States, you understand and agree that any information you provide to us on the Site will be transferred from the country of your residence or location at the time it was provided to the United States. If you do not want your personally-identifiable or sensitive personally-identifiable information to be transferred to the United States do not provide that information to us. By providing us with your information you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States.</p>
          <h4 class="h4">Changes to the Privacy Policy</h4>
          <p>We may make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and without notice to you. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy from time to time to understand whether any changes have been made. Unless otherwise stated, any modifications to this Privacy Policy will go into immediate effect after they have been posted, as indicated by the “Last Updated” date located at the end of this Privacy Policy. If you use the Site following any update to this Privacy Policy, it constitutes your acceptance of the modifications.</p>
