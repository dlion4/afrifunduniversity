                    <p><strong>&#8220;Dispute&#8221; Defined.</strong> Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this Arbitration Provision, &#8220;Dispute&#8221; broadly includes, without limitation: any claims based in contract, statute, constitution, ordinance, tort, fraud, consumer rights, misrepresentation, equity, or any other legal theory; initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims; federal, state, and local claims; and claims which arose before the date of your use of this Site, including, but not limited to, any dispute or claim arising before the date you accessed this Site or agreed to these Terms of Use and any dispute or claim relating to (by way of example and not limitation): (i) the use, denial, or termination of the Site and/or the events leading up thereto; (ii) any disclosure, advertisement, application, solicitation, promotion, or oral or written statement, warranty, or representation made by or on behalf of a Transaction Party; (iii) credit reporting or a Transaction Party&#8217;s use of consumer reports; (iv) any product or service provided by or through a Transaction Party or third parties in connection with the use of the Site or the relationship between you and a Transaction Party and any associated fees; (v) the collection of amounts due and the manner of collection; (vi) a Transaction Party&#8217;s use or failure to protect any personal information you give a Transaction Party in connection with the use of the Site or your relationship with the Transaction Party; (vii) enforcement of any and all of the obligations a party may have to another party in connection with the use of the Site or agreement governing the same; or (viii) compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Exceptions to &#8220;Dispute&#8221;.</strong> Notwithstanding any of the foregoing: (i) disputes or controversies about the validity, enforceability, coverage, or scope of this Arbitration Provision or any part thereof are for a court and not an arbitrator to decide; however, disputes or controversies about these Terms of Use or your agreements governing the use of the Site or with Transaction Parties as a whole are for an arbitrator and not a court to decide; (ii) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of intellectual property rights, will not be subject to binding arbitration under this Arbitration Provision; and (iii) any party may proceed with their individual claims in small claims court (or an equivalent court) if that option is available in the applicable jurisdiction and the amount in controversy falls within the small claims court&#8217;s (or the equivalent court&#8217;s) jurisdictional limits; but if that action is transferred, removed, or appealed to a different court, arbitration can be elected. Moreover, this Arbitration Provision will not apply to any Dispute that was already pending in court before this Arbitration Provision took effect.</p>
                    <p><strong>Governing Law.</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act (&#8220;FAA&#8221;), 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq., and federal arbitration law apply to this Arbitration Provision. There is no judge or jury in arbitration and court review of an arbitration award is limited, but an arbitrator can award an individual the same damages and relief as a court in an individual case and must apply and follow applicable substantive law, consistent with the FAA, and the terms of these Terms of Use and any agreement governing the use of the Site. The arbitrator shall apply applicable statutes of limitations and honor privilege rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator will be final, subject to any appeal rights under the FAA, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitration award involving the parties will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute involving anyone who is not a party to the arbitration, nor will an arbitration award in prior disputes involving other parties have preclusive effect in an arbitration between the parties to this Arbitration Provision.</p>
                    <p><strong>JURY TRIAL WAIVER.</strong> YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT YOUR CONSENT TO ARBITRATION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY.</p>


                    <p>
                        <strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong>
                        You and the Transaction Parties each agree that if arbitration of a Dispute is elected, the Dispute will be resolved in arbitration
                        (not in court) only on an individual basis and not as a class, collective or other representative action.
                        To the fullest extent permitted under the FAA: (a) no arbitration will be joined or consolidated with any other unless
                        all parties otherwise agree in writing; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action,
                        collective action or private attorney general basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for
                        any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
                        No arbitrator shall have the authority to issue any relief that applies to any person or entity other than Transaction Parties and/or you
                        individually.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Miscellaneous; Conflicts.</strong>
                        Even if all parties have opted to litigate a Dispute in court, a party may elect arbitration with respect to any claim made by a
                        new party or any claim later asserted by a party in that or any related or unrelated lawsuit (including a claim initially asserted on
                        an individual basis but modified to be asserted on a class, representative, or multi-party basis).
                        Nothing in that litigation shall constitute a waiver of any rights under this Arbitration Provision.
                        If any portion of this Arbitration Provision is inconsistent with the Consumer Rules, with these Terms of Use, or your agreements
                        governing the use of this Site, or with an arbitration provision in any agreement with a Transaction Party
                        (including, without limitation, any loan agreement), this Arbitration Provision shall govern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Survival; Severance.</strong>
                        This Arbitration Provision shall survive termination of the Site or these Terms of Use or of any agreement into which you enter with a
                        Transaction Party; and, further, you understand and agree that this Arbitration Provision applies not only to these Terms of Use but
                        also to any subsequent agreement (including without limitation any agreement governing the use of the Site or any loan agreement)
                        into which you enter with a Transaction Party. This Arbitration Provision stays in force even if you withdraw your loan application
                        or your application is denied, if any loan obtained by you is repaid in full, if any loan agreement or account is terminated or expires,
                        or in the event of any bankruptcy (if permitted by bankruptcy law). If any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or
                        unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision, except that: (a) if the Class Action Waiver
                        is limited, voided or found unenforceable with respect to a Dispute and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been
                        exhausted, then this Arbitration Provision (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding.
                        The parties acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated; and (b) if a claim is brought
                        seeking public injunctive relief and a court determines that the restrictions in the Class Action Waiver or elsewhere in this Arbitration
                        Provision prohibiting the arbitrator from awarding relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with respect to such claim and
                        that determination becomes final after all appeals have been exhausted, the claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in
                        court and any individual claims seeking monetary relief will be arbitrated. In such a case the parties will request that the court
                        stay the claim for public injunctive relief until the arbitration award pertaining to individual relief has been entered in court.
                        In no event will a claim for public injunctive relief be arbitrated.

                            Transaction Party through this site. You must send the notice in writing (and not electronically)

                            if applicable, and state that you &#8220;opt out&#8221; of the Arbitration Provision. Opting out will not affect the other provisions of
                            these Terms of Use or any other agreement governing the Site or with a Transaction Party. If you do not opt out, you will be bound by
                            this Arbitration Provision in these Terms of Use and any other agreement governing a Service or with a Transaction Party.
                            Please note that if you enter an agreement with a Transaction Party that contains a different arbitration provision with a
                            right to opt out, opting out of this Arbitration Provision is not a rejection of the arbitration provision in the other agreement.
                            You will need to separately opt out of the arbitration provision in the other agreement if you do not want it to apply
