                                <p>College Avenue has developed and maintains security standards that are designed to protect information as it is transmitted from your computer to the network that hosts the Site.

                                <p>However, you also have a significant role in maintaining the security of your information. For example, you should ensure that you have up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware software installed on your computer. You should also understand that College Avenue will never send you electronic communications (whether they be email or requests made over the Internet) to request sensitive personal information. Similarly, you should never send us your sensitive personal information through a non-secure email channel. If you do communicate with us electronically you consent for us (or our service providers) to reply to you in that medium.</p>
                                <p>You are also in control of the information that you share with College Avenue, either directly or indirectly.

You should review the privacy policies and practices of Third Party Sites before providing information to them.</p>
